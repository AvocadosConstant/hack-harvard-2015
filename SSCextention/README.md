# SnooSnoop Chrome Extension

SnooSnoop is a chrome extension built with javascript that adds a right click context menu to allow searching of users on [SnoopSnoo.com](SnoopSnoo.com)

## Inspiration

While SnoopSnoo makes it much easier to do data analysis of someone's account, it is a little bit of a hassle to have to type there name in, especially when you could just click. 
## How it works

Simply right click on the reddit user's link and select "Search SnoopSnoo for User", this should open a new tab and start searching right away.
